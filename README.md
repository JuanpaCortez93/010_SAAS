# 010_SAAS

In this project I built a basic Landing Page using SASS as part of the "SASS Fundamentals" at Platzi. 

The original project is set in Figma in the URL:  https://www.figma.com/file/Em1aDiIHmqozHpUAjsYhT7?type=design&node-id=43-2185&mode=design&t=MbwSX90NYyzwccwO-0
My result is the following: https://juanpacortez93.github.io/010_SAAS/

Also I added the following items:

1. "Like" interactivity button
2. Fetch products and furtinures items from JS

Really, I enojoyed this so much!
